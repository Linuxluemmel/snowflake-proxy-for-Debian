Debian 12 (bookworm) has a very old release of the snowflake-proxy (2.5.1) 

I created a new deb file with a few enhancments compared to the old
snowflake-proxy that Debian provides.

Version : 2.9.2 ( very new)
manual page 1 (snowflake-proxy) : I did add the missing options, that were missing in the man page from Debian 
user : The old Debian snowflake-proxy (2.5.2) have used root for running the proxy.The new Deb file is using a 
a other user to run the proxy.
